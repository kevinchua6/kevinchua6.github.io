Hey, I'm Kevin! Welcome to my website. I'm a software engineer and I love to build things. I'm passionate about technology and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills. I just graduated from NUS and am excited to document my journey with my first job. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you just want to chat. Thanks for stopping by!
